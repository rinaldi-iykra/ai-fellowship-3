# Supplier Performance Tracker
The Supplier Performance Tracker is a comprehensive system designed to manage the entire supplier list while also monitoring their performance.

This system supports the Procurement Team by evaluating supplier performance based on historical ratings and identifying potential new suppliers when current options are lacking.

This project has been developed by two engineers as part of the AI Engineering 2024 Batch I initiative by IYKRA.
